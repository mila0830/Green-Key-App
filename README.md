# Front End for GreenKey App
Below contains the basic information of starting a react application 

## To start
1. To get the beta version running:
* "npm start" on bash terminal for greenkey folder
* python -m uvicorn api:app --reload on bash terminal for the ESGResearch

## Different Components
### src -> components
This folder contains all the elements/components that I started to build for the web application

### src -> pages
This folder contains all the pages of the MVP of the web application
* home -> contains the home page
* table -> contains the page that will show the table after the ESG report is uploaded
* upload -> is the page where the ESG report should be uploaded
* also other misc pages like About, Contact, Footer that were started but not completed fully

### App.jsx
* this page holds all the basics of the web application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
